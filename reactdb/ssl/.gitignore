# SSL directory - contains certificates and private keys
# IMPORTANT: Never commit private keys (.key files) to version control!

# Ignore all files in this directory by default

# But track these instruction files
!.gitignore

# Certificates (.crt) can be tracked if they're for development only
# Uncomment if desired (but NOT for production):
# !nginx.crt

# SECURITY WARNING:
# Private key files (.key) MUST NEVER be committed to git
# If accidentally committed:
#   1. Revoke the certificate immediately
#   2. Generate a new certificate
#   3. Force-push to remove from history
# 
# For production:
# - Use automated certificate management (e.g., certbot)
# - Use certificate management services
# - Never store private keys in version control
